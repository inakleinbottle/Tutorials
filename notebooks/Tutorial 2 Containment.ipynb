    "# Tutorial 2: Containment\n",
    "In this tutorial we will see the various ways that we can store collections of data in Python. We have already seen some of the basic data types that are available in Python - int, str, and float - and now we will see that we can put many items of these types into different *containers*. The three main container types are *lists*, *tuples*, and *dicts*, and each has its own distinct properties.\n",

    "A list is a flexible container that can change its size depending on the needs of the user. A list is created by simply writing the data between square brackets, such as `a_list = ['string one', 'string two']`. This will create a new list object that contains the two strings `'string one'` and `'string two'`. The current *length* of a list can be accessed using the special `len` function in Python, and will return a non-negative integer representing the current number of items in the list."

The dot here tells Python that we want the append function that is attached to this particular list; this type of *referencing* will appear frequently in Python."

The key can be any *immutable* item - such as an int, str, float, or tuple - and the corresponding can be any type. For example, one might create a dictionary that maps employee numbers to the corresponding name of that employee: \n",
    "   ```python \n",
    "   name_dict = {1 : 'Alice',\n",
    "                2 : 'Bob', \n",
    "                3 : 'Charlie'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "To retrieve the name of a specific employee, we need only use look for the item indexed by the corresponding employee number, so that `name_dict[1] = Alice`, and so on. On the surface, this might look as if we are simply creating a list and accessing the index for the corresponding employee name, but a dictionary has more structure than a list. The value is strongly bound to the corresponding key in a dictionary, and this is not altered if other items are added to, or removed from, the dictionary. This would not be the case with a list."
