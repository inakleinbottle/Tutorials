    "Before we can discuss conditional statements we must understand the values of true and false in Python. A *Boolean* is a value that can be either *True* or *False*, and this is a basic type in Python with the values `True` and `False`. (Note that these are capitalised.) Whenever we use a conditional, the testing expression should always evaluate to one of these possiblilites. We should also note that Python has some short-cut features that allow certain values of other types to evaluate as `True` or `False`; we shall discuss these below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common method for obtaining a Boolean value is by *equality testing*, which is achieved using the equality operator `==`. (Note the double equals, which distinguishes equality test from assignment.) If we write `a == b`, Python will test whether the values of variables `a` and `b` are equal. Note that `a` and `b` need not be the *same* object, they need only have the same *value* in the eyes of the Python interpreter. If we wish to test whether two variables reference the same object, the we use the Python keyword `is`. This distinction can be useful, but most often we really need the equality operator `==`."
